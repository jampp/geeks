Identify your existing users and bring them back to your app.

You can re-engage inactive users and recover lost ones. Our RTB enabled
re-engagement technology helps you bring users back to your app.


We identify users that have already installed (or uninstalled) your app and display custom ads promoting newly added features or offers in an effort to bring them back. We also build segments dynamically based on the user activity within your app.

Generating additional revenue by re-engaging users is significantly more cost-effective than generating revenue from newly acquired users. Drive users to a special promotion within your app.
