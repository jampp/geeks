What's new

There are 3 main features:

<!--excerpt.start-->
- **Any Event**: You can now analyse performance easily within Ruby of **any** in-app event and metrics (CPA, ER, EVR, Etc).
<!--excerpt.end-->

- **Status of Data Sharing**: You can now see very graphically which in-app events our clients are sharing with us and which is the exact status (Are they sending it? Which was the last one? Any in-app event that they still need to add?)
- **Filters**: You can now filter any report by performance metrics (which are the rows that have a conversion &gt; 1.1%?).

And a lot of other features, small fixes and details (Client will be able to share reports, lots of new performance metrics, Cohorts by Apps/Campaigns, Clearer view of Dynamic Segments, etc).

But most importantly we are sharing all this info/features on our client's dashboard as well. If our internal Ruby is 2 times better than it was, the client dashboard is changing by 10 times.

Why this is important

In-app activity (sales, credit spending, etc, etc) is at the core of what our client needs and what we need to optimize.

Basically, what we do is driving more activity within our client's apps....no matter if that comes from app installs or re-targeting campaigns.

This release makes in-app event optimization much easier and scalable (instead of running many pivots you will see the same info everywhere).

But also, it give us an awesome base to build a lot of new features that we are planning soon:

- Create Black/Whitelist just from the performance reports.
- Automation Rules ("If conversion is below 1.2% pause the action")
- ...and many more.
