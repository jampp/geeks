          <p>What’s new</p>

<p>There are 3 main features:</p>

<!--excerpt.start-->
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Any Event</strong>: You can now analyse performance easily within Ruby of <strong>any</strong> in-app event and metrics (CPA, ER, EVR, Etc).
<!--excerpt.end--></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Status of Data Sharing</strong>: You can now see very graphically which in-app events our clients are sharing with us and which is the exact status (Are they sending it? Which was the last one? Any in-app event that they still need to add?)</li>
  <li><strong>Filters</strong>: You can now filter any report by performance metrics (which are the rows that have a conversion &gt; 1.1%?).</li>
</ul>

<p>And a lot of other features, small fixes and details (Client will be able to share reports, lots of new performance metrics, Cohorts by Apps/Campaigns, Clearer view of Dynamic Segments, etc).</p>

<p>But most importantly we are sharing all this info/features on our client’s dashboard as well. If our internal Ruby is 2 times better than it was, the client dashboard is changing by 10 times.</p>

<p>Why this is important</p>

<p>In-app activity (sales, credit spending, etc, etc) is at the core of what our client needs and what we need to optimize.</p>

<p>Basically, what we do is driving more activity within our client’s apps….no matter if that comes from app installs or re-targeting campaigns.</p>

<p>This release makes in-app event optimization much easier and scalable (instead of running many pivots you will see the same info everywhere).</p>

<p>But also, it give us an awesome base to build a lot of new features that we are planning soon:</p>
