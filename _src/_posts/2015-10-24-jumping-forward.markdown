5 Stars - Jun 11, 2015 - "I am too am embarrassed right now to go to the gym and this app is helping me get the exercise I need without the pressure of the gym. Love this app and the fact that it is connected to Spotify for my music."

A good product (duh!)
: Yes, seems obvious but the app stores are full of horrible apps. It’s important that the app is original (or improves on another app) or solves a problem or entertains. It has to be well designed, both in terms of how it looks and its user experience (UX). Everything that follows will be easier if the app is good. Something to keep in mind: The best apps only do “one thing” but they do that thing very very well.

Built In Virality
:     Try to incorporate some viral mechanism into the core functionality of the app, that way each user that uses and enjoys the app will potentially attract new users. In Instagram for example, the experience of looking at other people’s photos was much better with the app.

**The secret? The perfect playlist** to give you that extra motivation to get  started and keep you going.  Sworkit and URX teamed up to make it easy for users to access curated playlists that compliment their workout intensity and personalities.
